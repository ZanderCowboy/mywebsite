# Python Prediction Scripts

The project contains two Python scripts for predictions:

- [predict.py](mdc:predict.py): Main prediction script
- [predict_two.py](mdc:predict_two.py): Secondary prediction script with additional functionality

These scripts are likely used for machine learning or data processing tasks. They should be run from the project root directory.

Note: Make sure you have the required Python dependencies installed before running these scripts.
